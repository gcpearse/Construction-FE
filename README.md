# Construction

## Overview

This is the front-end repository of a web application designed for the construction industry. The aim is to provide construction managers with a convenient tool to track and update their services.

The application can be visited using [this link](http://4.234.160.181:9090/). Please note that valid user credentials are needed to access the full range of features, as this app is principally designed for internal business management.

For this project, I have paired up with a colleague - Chris - who is developing the back end in C#. The back-end repository can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ChrisRistoff/Construction-Backend), and the documentation for available endpoints can be accessed [here](http://4.234.160.181:8080/swagger/index.html).

## Tech Stack

This application is built in React with TypeScript and vanilla CSS. Redux Toolkit is used for the requisite Redux logic, including RTK Query for data fetching and caching.
