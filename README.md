# Construction

## Overview

This is the front-end repository of a prospective web application for the construction industry that will allow a client to advertise jobs and services online. The app is currently in the early stages of development.

For this project, I have paired up with a colleague - Chris - who is developing the back end in C#. The back-end repository can be visited [here](https://github.com/ChrisRistoff/Construction-Backend), and the documentation for available endpoints can be viewed [here](http://4.234.160.181:8080/swagger/index.html).

## Tech Stack

The front-end application is built in React with TypeScript and vanilla CSS. Redux Toolkit is used to write the requisite Redux logic, including RTK Query for data fetching and caching.
