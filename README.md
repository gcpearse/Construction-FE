# Construction

## Overview

This is the front-end repository of a web application for the construction industry that will allow business managers to advertise jobs and services online. 

For this project, I have paired up with a colleague - Chris - who is developing the back end in C#. The back-end repository can be visited [here](https://github.com/ChrisRistoff/Construction-Backend), and the documentation for available endpoints can be viewed [here](http://4.234.160.181:8080/swagger/index.html).

Although the site is still under develeopment, it is currently live and can be explored using [this link](http://4.234.160.181:9090/). Please note that valid user credentials are needed to access the full range of features, as this app is principally designed for business managers.

## Tech Stack

The app is being built in React with TypeScript and vanilla CSS. Redux Toolkit is used to write the requisite Redux logic, including RTK Query for data fetching and caching.
