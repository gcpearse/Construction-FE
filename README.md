# Construction

## Overview

This is the front-end repository of a prospective web application for the construction industry that will allow clients to log in and advertise jobs and services online. The app is currently under initial development.

For this project, I have paired up with a colleague - Chris - who is developing the back end in C#. The back-end repository can be visited [here](https://github.com/ChrisRistoff/Construction-Backend), and available endpoints can be found [here](http://4.234.160.181:8080/swagger/index.html).

## Tech Stack

The application is built in React with TypeScript and vanilla CSS. Redux Toolkit is used to write the requisite Redux logic, including RTK Query for data fetching and caching.
